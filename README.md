How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

A major way to ensure my code is functional and secure is by performing tests to check that it meets all of its requirements
and expectations. Throughout this course, I used JUnit testing to conduct tests on my program. JUnit tests allowed me to view
the project requirements and peform concise, repeatable tests that would notify me if a line or lines of code did not perform
the function that I expected it to. This helps ensure that the program remains functional and secure by checking that it behaves
in the way it is supposed to.


How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

When programming a piece of software, it is important to interpret the user needs and incorporate them in an appropriate way. One 
way to do this is by checking the project requirements document. Here, a programmer can look at all the general ideas and requests
of the user and begin thinking about the ways they can be incorporated into the project. If there is any confusion, it is always a 
good idea to get clarification from the user before continuining on with your work. Finally, I can use testing techniques to ensure
that the code meets the needs and requirements throughout the project. For example, if a user's phone number can only be 10 digits 
long, I can perform tests that prove false if a phone number is created that is not 10 digits. Based on the result of the test, I
know whether or not my program meets the needs of the user.

How do I approach designing software?

I am still learning what approach works best for me when designing software. In the early stages, I like to take it slow so that I 
know I am prepared to start working on the project. I usually start by reading the project requirements a few times and taking notes
on what I will need to accomplish. I can then start thinking about the ways I plan on acheiving these tasks. Once I have a plan in 
place, I can begin working on the actual code.
